# Homework 7

1. Divs and Spans by themselves don't do anything but they can be assigned classes which CSS can alter how the elements within a div or a span look. Ids are also assigned to divs or spans which can also be controlled in CSS.

2. Alt text is used if the element of the site is unable to load for any reason that it can display what that element was.

3. My work flow was similar to past assignments. It was watching the walkthrough video and then going through the homework website. From there I would look at the directions and refer to the homework website when I need to. While working on the assignment I started by making the outline for everything and then from there making everything more detailed and closer to final product for the assignment.
