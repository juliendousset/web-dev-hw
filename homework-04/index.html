        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>
            The <b>tao</b> that can be told
            <br />
            is not the eternal <b>Tao</b>
            <br />
            The name that can be named
            <br />
            is not the eternal Name.
        </p>
        <p>   
            The unnamable is the eternally real.
            <br />
            Naming is the origin
            <br />
            of all particular things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
            <br />
            Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet mystery and manifestations
            <br />
            arise from the same source.
            <br />
            This source is called darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Darkness within darkness.
            <br />
            The gateway to all understanding.
