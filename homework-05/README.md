# Homework 5

1. There can only be one head and one body element for each page. The head has elements about the site, has the title and favicon of a site, and is where css and javascript files are linked. The Body is where the actual elements of the page will show up.

2. Structural Markup determines how the elements will be displayed on screen, while semantic markup changes how elements can be interacted with or changes whether they are bold,
italic, etc.

3. For this assignment I quickly went through the walkthrough video, and then I quickly went through the homework website. Then I went over to the instructions for the assignment.
From there I followed the instructions and referred to the homework website when I needed to. However a lot of these things I have already gone over in a previous class, so I didn't learn that much. However, I did learn more about proper code writing. For example with the meta elements in the head.
