# Homework 6

1. All forms are to collect data. Whether its for a survey or for a login page. Generally, they are very clear what kind of data is supposed to go into each input and are very cleanly organized.

2. Things like Radio buttons or dropdowns would likely be used in forms where there are only a few options for the data to work. Or Checkboxes with things asking you "Do you Agree to the terms and conditions".

3. My work cycle for this assignment was similar to last time, however, this time there was more I did not know (such as I learned a lot more things about forms). Therefore, I had to refer the website a lot more and follow along with the assignment directions.
