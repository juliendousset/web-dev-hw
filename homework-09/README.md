# Homework 9

1. The differences between universal, element, class, and id selectors are just changing what the CSS targets. With Universal and elements in your CSS they target every element or every element of a specific type like headers. With Class and ID selectors one is able to target specific elements of a page that are in divs or spans to block them off from other elements of a page.

2. I used rgba(199, 126, 126, 0.5), a pink color, rgba(88, 119, 211, 0.5), a light blue color, rgba(0, 0, 0.5), black, and rgb(155, 155, 155), a grey color for the background of the page. I chose these colors because some of Jean-Luc Godard's films are black and white and I wanted to portray that in black, white, and grey colors. However I also went with a pink and a light blue because they contrast with eachother and it is a color palette featured in some of his films.

3. For this project I watched the walkthrough video and then went over and looked through the website. Afterwords I looked at the instructions for the assignment and figured out what I wanted to do for this assignment. Once I figured that out I worked on the website and referred to the assignment website when I needed to.
