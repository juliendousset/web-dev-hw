# Homework 12

1. My Imaginary Client is a restaurant. They want their contact, their menu, and their open hours on their site. Additionally, they want to share their story about how they started their business.

2. Block elements will accept many CSS rules given to it, and take up as much space given to them. While inline elements will ignore a lot of rules given to them, and only take up the amount of space they need on the page. Inline-block will accept some CSS rules, and have them take up more space on the page but they do not get their own line.

3. For this assignment I looked at the directions, and then looked at the walkthrough video and the assignment website. From their I decided what I was going to do for this project. I took a lot of the CSS I did from the previous project, but changed it a lot to fit this project. From their, I outlined each page of the website and increasingly added more and more detail.
