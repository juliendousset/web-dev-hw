# Final Website

1. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

Throughout the class I learned more about how Version Control works and other features of Github. One thing I do want to learn more about is using Github in a more collaborative project with others.

2. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

One of the things I really wanted to do was to make sure my website looked good mobile, and so I learned how to use Media Queries in CSS to change my layout depending on the width of the screen. One thing I never really thought about, but now realize is really important is making sure your website is accessible with alt tags on my images etc.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

For this project I looked through the instructions and started figuring out what I wanted to make. I started with some designs from previous projects and starting changing them to fit this one more. I started with my outline and continuely added more detail to the website. If there was something I wanted to do, but didn't know how to, then I looked it up and implemented it into my project.
