                        <li>However if your computer is frozen, hold down on the Power Button</li>

                    Your Computer is likely shutdown but here are a few things to look out for
                    <ul>
                        <li>You want to make sure there are no lights that are still on</li>
                        <li>
                            However, some computers will have lights indicating that it is charging but the computer is off.
                            <br>
                            So make sure that it is plugged in if you're are getting charging lights
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Now, it is time to press the power button on your computer to turn it back on</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There is a 95% chance that your computer is now working</p>
