2. I understand the very basics of CSS, however, I am excited to learn more ways to style pages in CSS.

3. For this project I started out by watching the walkthrough video. Then I started by outlining each page and then adding more and more details to each page. While adding detail to each page, I was making sure I was following the instructions.
